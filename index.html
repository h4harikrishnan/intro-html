            <title>Broke my trust on myself</title>
        </head>
        You took me by hand,
        helped me pick up shattered pieces of myself.
        Let me believe, my hypothesis on trust is not true,
        and that trust is not an alien.
        Believing in you, I took my baby steps into
        the unknown world of love and trust, from the
        inhumane world of jealousy, self pride and unjustness.
        Before I could breathe, you pushed me
        into the deep, never to make it mack to you.
        Breaking my trust on you,
        inturn,
        broke my trust on myself.
